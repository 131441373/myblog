Open the terminal or folder structure where the current project is stored; 
Close the Qt creator completely
Rename the containing folder also to new_name
Rename the old_name.pro to new_name.pro
Inside the new_name.pro, rename the TARGET = new_name
You may delete the debug & release folders of old_name project which were stored in parallel to the old_name folder
Restart the Qt creator; Open the project new_name.pro
also suggest deleting the .pro.user cache files since they won't be used after changing the project's name.
